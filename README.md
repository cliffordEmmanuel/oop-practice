# Practice projects with OOP in python

My motivation is to understand and implement the concepts of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) with Python. 
This will be a series of projects I undertake as I explore adding OOP to my python toolset. 
I also explore the learning by doing approach here by basically using DIYs from blog posts / articles.

## [Building an Area Shape Resolver Calculator](https://github.com/cliffordEmmanuel/oop-practice/tree/main/shape-calculator).

This simple project calculates the area of some basic shapes. Original blog post can be found
